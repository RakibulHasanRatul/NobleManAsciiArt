# NobleManAsciiArt

This project generates ASCII art of the famous Bangladeshi singer Mainul Ahsan Noble.

## Description

NobleManAsciiArt is a simple project that converts a photograph of Mainul Ahsan Noble into ASCII art. The ASCII representation is displayed in an HTML file, creating a unique and artistic rendition of the singer's image using only text characters.

## Contents

- `index.html`: Contains the ASCII art representation of Mainul Ahsan Noble.
- `src_image.jpg`: The source photograph of Mainul Ahsan Noble used to generate the ASCII art.

## Source Image

![Mainul Ahsan Noble](src_image.jpg)

## How it Works

The project uses an image-to-ASCII conversion technique to transform the source image (`src_image.jpg`) into a text-based representation. This ASCII art is then embedded in the `index.html` file, which can be viewed in any web browser.

## Viewing the ASCII Art

To view the ASCII art:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
